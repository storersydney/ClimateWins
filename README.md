# ClimateWins
## Objective
Use machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change.
## Key Questions
* How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?
* Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
* Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day? (If so, it could also be possible to predict danger.)
* Can machine learning be used to predict natural disasters such as hurricanes?
## Data
This data set is based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe, which contain data ranging from the late 1800s to 2022. Recordings exist for almost every day with values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and more. This data is collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project.
## Potential Bias
* The dataset includes weather data from just 18 weather stations across Europe. It’s possible that this is not a large enough sample to make assumptions about Europe’s diverse climate.
* Since the data goes all the way back to the 1800s, this large of a temporal sample could skew machine learning algorithms that should possibly be focusing more on recent data.
* Ethical concerns: Climate change is a polarizing topic, so it is important to be impartial when analyzing the data.
## Technology Used
